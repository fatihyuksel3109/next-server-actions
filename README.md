# Next.js Server Actions Infinite Scroll Project

This project is a Next.js application initialized with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), leveraging TypeScript and Next.js version 14.0.3. The styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS.

## Live Site

Visit the live site: [Next.js Server Actions Infinite Scroll](https://next-server-actions-fyuksel.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

To initiate the development server, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

You can commence editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you make changes to the file.

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.

## Infinite Scroll Feature

This project is specifically enhanced with an infinite scroll feature. As you scroll through the content, additional data will be dynamically loaded, providing a seamless and uninterrupted user experience.

## Framer Motion and React Intersection Observer
To further enhance the user interface and interaction, this project integrates Framer Motion and React Intersection Observer packages.

To install the required packages, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install framer-motion react-intersection-observer
# or
yarn add framer-motion react-intersection-observer
# or
pnpm install framer-motion react-intersection-observer
# or
bun install framer-motion react-intersection-observer
These packages provide powerful animation and intersection observer capabilities, allowing for smooth transitions and dynamic content loading.
