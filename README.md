# Next.js Server Actions Infinite Scroll Project

This project is a Next.js application initialized with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), leveraging TypeScript and Next.js version 14.0.3. The styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To initiate the development server, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

You can commence editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you make changes to the file.

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.

## Infinite Scroll Feature

This project is specifically enhanced with an infinite scroll feature. As you scroll through the content, additional data will be dynamically loaded, providing a seamless and uninterrupted user experience.
